# Scripts

Utility and operational scripts.

- Legacy one-off migration/formatting scripts (e.g., `fix_two_phase_indent.py`, `fix_two_phase_properly.py`) should be relocated to `scripts/legacy/` if still needed.
- Training or experimental scripts (e.g., `train_meta_learner.py`) should include a short usage README and avoid writing tracked artifacts.
