# Autonomous Revenue Department Design - Three Rivers Tech

**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Vision:** Build technology that auto-compounds and grows autonomously  
**Priority:** Minimize service work, maximize product/infrastructure revenue

---

## Strategic Focus: Revenue Streams

### Primary (Autonomous, Compounding)
1. **Trading Bots** (FFE as a service/product)
2. **Server Rentals** (Proxmox infrastructure, compute market)
3. **On-Prem Hardware Sales** (configured systems, profit per unit)
4. **Passive Compute** (Storj nodes, Flux, IO.net, Vast.ai)
5. **Infrastructure Services** (managed hosting, turnkey solutions)

### Secondary (Necessary, Limited)
6. **High-Value Consulting** (enterprise only, $5K+ projects)
7. **Repair Revenue** (necessary evil, time-boxed weekly)

### Avoid (Service-Heavy)
❌ Constant house calls  
❌ Small repair jobs (<$500)  
❌ Endless customer hand-holding  
❌ One-off service requests

## What NOT to Build (Minimize Service Work)

### ❌ Customer Success Department
**Why skip:** Service-heavy, doesn't scale, time-intensive

**Alternative:** Self-service onboarding, knowledge base, community forum

**Exception:** ONE person (or fractional time) for high-value clients only (>$5K/year)

### ❌ Traditional Sales Team
**Why skip:** Cold calling, demos, hand-holding doesn't fit autonomous revenue model

**Alternative:** Inbound marketing, partnerships, self-service trials

**Exception:** BD for large partnerships (white-label, enterprise deals)

### ❌ Full-Time Support Team
**Why skip:** Endless tickets, reactive work, doesn't compound

**Alternative:** Documentation, automation, community support

**Exception:** Escalation path for critical issues (paying customers only)

---

## Repair/Service Work Management

**Philosophy:** Necessary evil, not growth driver. Time-box strictly.

### Rules:
1. **10 hours/week maximum** on service work (repairs, house calls)
2. **$500 minimum** for house calls (filter out low-value)
3. **Prepayment required** (reduces no-shows, time-wasters)
4. **Automated scheduling** (online booking, no phone tag)
5. **Knowledge base first** (most issues solved via docs)

### Pricing strategy:
- **House calls:** $150 base + $100/hr (premium pricing filters clients)
- **Remote support:** $75/hr (encourage remote over on-site)
- **Repairs:** Parts + 50% markup + $100 labor minimum
- **Consulting:** $200/hr (enterprise clients only)

### Automation:
- Online booking system (Calendly or custom)
- Diagnostic flowcharts (customer self-diagnoses)
- Parts ordering automation (customer orders, we configure)
- Follow-up automation (post-service surveys, upsells)

---

## Revenue Stream Prioritization

### Tier 1: Autonomous, Compounding (80% of effort)
1. **FFE Trading Bot** - MRR or profit-sharing
2. **Server Rentals** - GPU compute, managed hosting
3. **Passive Compute** - Storj, Flux, etc.
4. **On-Prem Hardware** - Configured systems, documented setups

### Tier 2: Semi-Autonomous (15% of effort)
5. **High-Value Consulting** - Enterprise only, $5K+ minimum
6. **White-Label Licensing** - FFE or other products

### Tier 3: Necessary Evil (5% of effort)
7. **Repair Revenue** - Time-boxed, premium pricing

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation
1. ✅ Product Engineering team (already building FFE)
2. ✅ Infrastructure & RevOps (Proxmox, GPU laptop already running)
3. 🔄 Marketing Manager design (in progress)

### Week 2-4: Growth Systems
4. Finance & Analytics (revenue tracking, dashboards)
5. Operations & Automation (self-service, time-boxing)
6. Marketing execution (blog content, SEO, social)

### Month 2: Scale
7. Business Development (partnerships, white-label)
8. Product expansion (FFE SaaS, additional products)
9. Infrastructure scaling (more GPU nodes, Storj expansion)

### Month 3+: Optimization
10. Refine automation (reduce manual work to <5 hrs/week)
11. Expand passive revenue streams
12. Exit low-value service work entirely

## Next Steps

1. **Design detailed role specs** for each department
2. **Marketing Manager** role (immediate priority)
3. **Operations & Automation** role (reduce service load)
4. **Finance Manager** role (multi-stream tracking)

Should I start with Marketing Manager design, or would you prefer Operations & Automation first (to time-box service work)?
